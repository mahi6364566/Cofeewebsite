    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <div style="width: 50%;">
    <p class="text">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard 
        dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five 
        centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
         essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
          release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem 
        Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
         PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
